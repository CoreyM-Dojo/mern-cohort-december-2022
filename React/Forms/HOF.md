# React Forms - Week 2 Day 3

- Office Hours: 4:00 PM PST
- Lecture: 5:00 PM PST

## Office Hours

- Lets do some refactoring!

### Exercise

- Make a component called YourName.jsx
- create a variable as an initial state for form data
- create a form with the intended handlers
- Display the string value below your input
- Display an alert with the form data  

## Lecture

### Map and Filter

    - mapping through a list (JS)
    - filtering a list and displaying the remaining information
    - using them together

### Handling forms

    - Handling errors
    - conditional rendering

### updating lists in state

    - state is immutable
    - never try to mutate state directly
    - using the spread operator with state

### Putting it all together

    - initialize a list in state
    - create a record from form data in an object
    - Upon submitting, add that record to the list of records
    - Map through that list and display the contents of each record

## Questions

### After

- Can we use normal if statements in react? What can we use instead?
- What can we use to update a list in state?
- what is the functionality of array.map? array.filter?
